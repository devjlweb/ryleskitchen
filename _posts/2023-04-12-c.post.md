We couldn't have asked for a more perfect wedding cake than the one Ryle's Kitchen created for us. The 3-layer cake with the light-colored roses on the sides and 'Mr & Mrs' on top was the epitome of elegance.

And the taste was heavenly! Thank you for adding to the magic of our special day with this beautiful and delicious cake.
