I got my daughter a bloom of summer with this delicious creamy adorned plate and for sure it's a wonderful cake.

Will definitely be coming back! Its her graduation and they exceeded my expectations. They were almost too cute to eat. They were delicious and the price are very reasonable. Would highly recommend.
