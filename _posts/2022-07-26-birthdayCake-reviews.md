If anyone knew how to bake a cake it was Joan; she made
the most special birthday cakes of anyone around town. From
her run down house, from inside the adorned walls, she made cakes
fit for royalty!

The cake was decorated exactly how we asked for. They accommodated for mine and my momâ€™s gluten-free dietary restriction. The cake tasted very good and was not overly sweet and it was on time.
