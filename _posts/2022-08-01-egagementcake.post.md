It was just as amazing as it looked. The vanilla flavor is perfect, and the buttercream frosting was light and creamy. The cake was sweet, but not too sweet, and it left a delightful aftertaste that lingered long after the last bite.

 Overall, I couldn't be happier with my experience ordering an engagement cake from Ryle's Kitchen. The cake itself was absolutely delicious, and the design was perfect for the occasion. I would highly recommend this bakery to anyone looking for a beautiful and delicious cake for any occasion.
