For my friend's recent birthday, I wanted to do something special and unique, so I decided to surprise her with a beer cake. Yes, you read that right - a cake made with beer!

Overall, I would highly recommend a beer cake for your next birthday celebration or special occasion. It's a unique and delicious way to combine two of life's greatest pleasures - beer and cake!
